## User Documentation

A quick informative description of the project for use by the end user.

### Project Desciption

This project was created to benefit working medical professionals and their patients through enhanced communication between the two parties. The intended outcome of the project is for patients to receive more immediate response from a physician (or group of physicians) based on ongoing treatments or medical issues, and for a physician to receive more accurate and immediate response from patients, which may give them the ability to improve patient care. Through secure methods of information transfer, patient care no longer must be limited to clinical visits, but hopefully can be done from the comfort of home in some instances, especially when a patient may be at risk of picking up or spreading pathogens at a physical clinic. Through a our medical social network, patient care can be practiced in a safer and more efficient manner.

### How to obtain and Run Software

There is no physical software necessary to run our system, users simply need to navigate to the url at [http://medicalsocial.000webhostapp.com/](http://medicalsocial.000webhostapp.com/)

### How to use the software

The use of the software is similar to that of any other social media website, except that because of the nature of the data on this social media platform, further steps must be taken to ensure the proper indentity of both patient and doctor. For doctors, `#####` will be needed upon the account creating process to confirm credentials and identity, wheras on the patient side `#####` will be needed. While at this stage of the production process the tools are not yet created for these processes and adding of connections between patients and doctors, these descriptions will be added futher into the production cycle.

### Reporting a Bug

To report a bug, simply navigate to the "report a problem" link towards the bottom of any page, which will take you to a report form for you to fill out. Please remember to include a good desciptive title at the top of the report, as well as strong descriptions of where on the site you encountered the problem and what exactly the problem entailed within the report itself. If the bug persist or prevents you from doing anything within the site (eg. more than a cosmetic bug) select the appropriate boxes beneath the report before hitting submit.


## Documentation for Developers

## To obtain source code:
Latest stable version will always be master, so clone the repo and pull that branch.

# To run:
1.) Clone the repository to your local machine

2.) In terminal, cd MedicalSocialNetwork/

3.) run npm install

4.) run npm run dev

5.) point your browser to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

# To run test:
Make sure the project is running from 'medicalSocialNetwork'
Open another terminal and cd into 'client'
`npm run test`

# Automated weekly builds
Our software uses Travis CI to perform continious integration.  It will run the build and tests each time a commit is made to master.  

# Releasing a new version of the software

We will be releasing new versions of our website week to week, and will provide updated zip files with corresponding version numbers to make it clear which build is our most current on git. We will likely have main and sub releases on a regular basis as we continue to build or application, with new builds being announced on old builds so that individuals can stay up to date.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

Repository for Medical Social Network project

Medical Social network The goal of this project is to create a social networkwhere you can choose to connect ("friend") with your clinicians to share information with them. Following are the requirement:

1.Ability for clinicians to register after verifying their credentials.

2.Ability for patients to register.

3.Ability for a patient friend one or more clinicians.

4.Ability for the clinicians to “friend” their patients.

5.Ability for patients to share information that they think is necessary with the clinician.

6.Ability for clinicians to share information with the patients.

7.Use a secured data host and a 3rd party electronic health care integrator(Google Cloud platform healthcare API may be able to theoretically solve both problems
